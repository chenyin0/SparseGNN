edge of an integer-weighted graph based on a maximum likelihood null model derived
from the configuration model

         Graph is one of the following:

         can be integers or strings and weight is integer. The output list will consist
         of 4-tuples and the 4th tuple is the significance score.
         - an igraph.Graph instance where each edge has an integer attribute "weight".
         The output will be a Graph instance with an additional edge attribute
         "significance"
         - a pandas.DataFrame with three columns: "source", "target", "weight" where
         "weight" values are positive integers. The output will have an additional
